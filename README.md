## Abstract
Context: Traditionally, software development has been predominantly supported by a variety of non-AI tools and methodologies. However, with the introduction of Generative AI (GenAI) tools such as GPT-4, the landscape has changed significantly, opening up new opportunities to improve all activities that are part of the software development process. Objective: To explore the usage of GenAI to the different phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): *Requirements*, *Architecture and Design*, *Construction*, *Testing* and *Maintenance*. By examining these aspects, it is targeted where and how GenAI tools are being applied and assesses their potential while adhering to established SDLC standards and coding practices. Method: A systematic mapping study (SMS) was conducted using the SCOPUS database, by considering the studies published between January 2022 and July 2024. From the 256 retrieved studies, 48 were selected as primary papers. Results: GenAI is most widely used in the *Construction* and *Testing* phases, improving efficiency by automating repetitive, structured tasks. In contrast, phases requiring more creativity and strategic thinking, such as *Requirements*, *Architecture and Design* and *Maintenance*, pose significant challenges for the evolution of GenAI, where enhancing the synergy between GenAI and human experience is essential. Conclusion: The gaps in the the *Requirements*, *Architecture and Design*, and *Maintenance* phases highlight key areas for future research. Efforts should focus on evolving GenAI to better support these phases and help expand its role throughout the SDLC.
