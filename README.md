## Abstract
Context: Traditionally, software development has relied on a range of non-AI support tools. However, with the introduction of Generative AI (GenAI) tools such as GPT-4, the landscape has changed significantly, opening up new opportunities to improve all activities that are part of the software development process.
Objective: This Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) aims to explore the application of GenAI to the different phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): _Requirements_, _Architecture and Design_, _Construction_, _Testing_ and _Maintenance_. By examining these aspects, the review identifies where and how GenAI tools are being applied and assesses their potential while adhering to established SDLC standards and coding practices. 
Method: The research objective was defined using parts of the Goal-Question-Metric model and the search query was designed using Population and Intervention criteria. From 256 studies that were retrieved from the search execution, 48 were selected and analysed to answer the research questions. 
Results: GenAI is most widely used in the _Construction_ and _Testing_ phases, improving efficiency by automating repetitive tasks. In contrast, phases requiring more creativity and strategic thinking, such as _Requirements_, _Architecture and Design_ and _Maintenance_, pose significant challenges for the evolution of GenAI, where enhancing the synergy between AI automation and human experience is essential.
Conclusion: The gaps in the _Requirements_, _Architecture and Design_} and _Maintenance_ phases highlight key areas for future research. Efforts should focus on developing advanced GenAI solutions to support these phases, helping to extend the role of GenAI across the SDLC.
